<p>  Outstanding traction, increased driving dynamics and more driving safety. Or to put it briefly: Quattro. Hardly any other drive brings the engine's power to the road so confidently.
          In a technical variant, the central component is the self-locking centre differential. In its basic design, this purely mechanical planetary gear distributes drive torques asymmetrically to favour driving dynamics. With a 40:60 ration between the front and rear axle. If necessary, up to 70 percent can be directed to the front wheels, or up to 85 percent to the rear wheels to counteract slip.
          In a further technical variant, the permanent all-wheel drive is coupled with an electronically controlled and hydraulically operated multi-disc clutch for power distribution. Furthermore, the wheel-selective torque control counteracts unwanted wheel slip through targeted braking interventions on all wheels. This results in controllable and sporty handling combined with outstanding traction.

<p> The SLS AMG's high revving 6.2 L normally aspirated V8 engine is changed into a furious power house by the KLEEMANN SUPERCHARGER, the product signature of the Danish high performance tuning specialist. Supercharger system is manufactured from billet aluminum, carefully milled out from solid alloy blocks, and black anodized. The fi nished assembly looks and feels factory, there is no disappointment when the hat is popped.

In the highest performance trim, the complete system has undergone a complete redesign as well. The optional polished stainless exhaust system comes in 2 variants. A bolt on a back system with a dual mid muffler and X section plus a flapper controlled rear section. This can be used with a remote control for the sound of a car. the addition of a new catalyst section gives you a better sound, and more importantly, it frees the exhaust and the heat buildup against the engine to the supercharger to be geared to a higher ratio.

<p> The Lamborghini Aventador SV – for Superveloce – backs up the promise of its aggressive, fighter jet styling; it is a monster of a supercar. As evidenced by its Nurburgring lap time of 6min 59secs it has the raw performance to live with hybrid hypercars costing three times the SV’s £315,000. Supercar driving experiences do not come more authentic than this. 

In dynamic terms the SV feels sharper and more agile than the standard Aventador, but that car was hardly lacking in dynamic ability itself. Equipped with the vast rear wing and contrasting styling elements the SV looks incredible on the road. Few cars have ever snapped the necks of onlookers quite so readily as this one.The single-clutch gearbox has been improved slightly for this installation, but the thinly padded bucket seats offer no lower back support and their long distance comfort is non-existent.

<p> The beautifully crafted Huayra serves up supercar excess in the finest tradition. Lurking beneath the attractive body is a 720bhp twin-turbo Mercedes V12 that propels the Pagani to 238mph.

The Huayra is constructed from carbon fibre and employs an active aerodynamic system that can adjust the ride height at the front and rear of the car independently – as well as automatically deploying the various wings and spoilers. The latest Huayra BC edition ramps the power up by a marginal 10 per cent, which we don’t expect to make too much of an impact on the top speed. However the Huayra Roadster is another proposition that's aiming to take the title of the World’s Fastest Convertible…

<p> Equipped with a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8, the Agera RS produces 1176 horsepower and 940 lb-ft of torque in standard form. The 1MW upgrade boosts these numbers to 1360 hp and an even 1,000 lb-ft. When equipped with the upgrade, the Agera RS reaches 60 mph in under 2.9-seconds and blasts to 124 mph in under 7-seconds. This is achieved even with a traction-limiting rear-wheel drive setup, a 7-speed paddle-shift transmission is standard.

The much-publicized top speed of 277.9 mph is currently the highest of any road car ever built and the RS also holds the record for a number of other performance benchmarks too. The engine has been designed to offer its maximum output even with regular gasoline and E85 ethanol can be used in certain markets.

<p> The F-Type SVR is the next logical step up from the F-Type R on which it's based. While the R model makes do with 550 hp, the SVR's supercharged 5.0-liter V8 cranks out 575 horses, alongside 516 lb.-ft. of torque. The SVR is also lighter: The SVR Coupe weighs in 55 lbs lighter than the hardtop F-Type R, with an additional 46 lbs of weight loss possible if you choose the optional carbon ceramic brakes. Toss in some other lightweight details, like an optional carbon fiber roof panel and other various bits, and Jaguar says you can realize a weight loss of 110 lbs in your SVR coupe—minimum weight figures come in at 3759 lbs for the coupe, 3792 for the convertible.
There's a bit of finicky semantics going on here, of course—the legendary and gorgeous Jaguar XJ220 briefly held the title of world's fastest car, with a top speed of 213 mph, before the McLaren F1 came along.

<p> TFormula One technology is abundant in the LaFerrari - as you might expect with a £1million price tag. It's set to go down in history as one of the most sought-after cars ever - so read on below to find out everything there is to know about it.
 The LaFerrari's mid-mounted 6.3-litre V12 engine is electrically assisted by Ferrari's HY-KERS system to deliver a total power output of 950bhp. It's enough to make the LaFerrari's rumoured top speed of 227mph a realistic posibility and to see the car past 62mph in under three seconds.

<p> McLaren was the first brand to utilise a carbon fibre chassis in a production road going car after the F1 team had first started using the carbon composite in 1981. The carbon fibre tub helped drop the weight of the F1 road car significantly to 1018kg. 

Using a mid-mounted bespoke 6.1-litre V12 naturally-aspirated engine built by BMW Motorsport which produced 404kW and 600Nm. Gordon Murray insisted that the F1 feature a naturally-aspirated engine as he believed turbochargers and superchargers created a disconnect with the driver and lowered the reliability of the engine. 

McLaren's six-speed gearbox was specifically designed for the F1 with an intent focus of minimising size by adding the final drive gear offset alongside its clutch. A close five-speed cluster for the gearbox is used at speeds up to 257km/h with a sixth speed gear for speeds up to 321km/h.

<p> It was powerful, fast, radically different from any other Aston Martin, and built in limited numbers. It was also a track-only vehicle, which made it even more exotic. Two years later and the Vulcan returns, this time with an AMR Pro upgrade that makes it even more aerodynamic.

Launched in early 2017, AMR is the company’s new performance brand that basically brings the technology seen in Aston Martin Racing competition cars to customer vehicles. Essentially a body kit upgrade to the already potent Vulcan, the AMR Pro package makes the supercar more aerodynamic and quicker at the race track. At the same time, it moves Aston Martin closer to the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, and McLaren, companies that have solid customer racing programs and highly customizable products thanks to bespoke high-performance divisions.

<p> The CHIRON is the fastest, most powerful, and exclusive production super sports car in BUGATTI’s history. Its sophisticated design, innovative technology, and iconic, performance-oriented form make it a unique masterpiece of art, form and technique, that pushes boundaries beyond imagination.
The heart of the CHIRON is its quad-turbocharged 8 l W16 engine. This unique masterpiece generates an incredible 1,500 hp and 1,600 Nm of torque, with an almost linear power output between 2,000 and 6,000 rpm. Four high-performing turbochargers work in a two-stage controlled configuration, and define this champion of performance. A remarkable 60,000 litres of air are pumped through the engine every minute.
